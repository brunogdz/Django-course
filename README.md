# Django Tutorial

Welcome to Django Tutorial, I'm Bruno, welcome again, I'm glad that you showed up! So, this is just a few steps to have contact with Django Framework!!

I hope that you'd contact with python before, so, there are the steps to run the first Django App!

## Steps

### Step 1

Create on your VS Code a folder

### Step 2

Make sure you have Django installed. If it's not

```
pip3 install django
```

We are now ready to use django and create our first Django project

Check with this command:

```
python3 -m django --version
```

### Step 3

Run to start the project

```
django-admin startproject myproject
```
